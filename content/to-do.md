- Fix page titles in leaf bundles so they show up as the directory title, and not just as "Index" (coming from index.md within the direcctory)
- Start writing posts about how to:
  - install Proxmox
  - install ubunto onto a proxmox and get docker running
  - install portainer
  - install sonarr, jackett, radarr, with qbittorrent
  - using docker-compose
